# gap-miner-v2-tango57 overview

`nam20485/gap-miner-v2-tango57` is a GitHub template repository that provides the substrate for AI agent development workflows. Each downstream instance is cloned from this template to house a unique application plan and develop it using a structured, agent-driven process.

The repo ships three main things:

1. **An operating manual** (`AGENTS.md`) that tells AI agents how to work in any clone of this repo: coding guidelines, validation rules, source control conventions, delegation patterns, and tool usage.
2. **A memory and rules system** (`.agents/`) with durable project context (`memory.md`), subject-specific rules files (one per topic), and agent skills.
3. **The `gh-issue-tracking-init` skill** that scaffolds a GitHub issue-based planning hierarchy (plan to epic to story to task) with linked sub-issues, a Projects v2 board, milestones, and labels, all driven by idempotent PowerShell scripts.

All scripts are written in cross-platform PowerShell 7+ and use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for API operations. The repo has 100 tracked files across 120 commits, with 190 Pester tests at 93.91% coverage.
